# Stock-Watcher

Stock Watcher uses real time stock data to alert users via e-mail when a stock in their portfolio reaches a desired price. Stock data provided by [Alpha Vantage](www.alphavantage.co) and makes use of [mirgj's wrapper](https://github.com/mirgj/alphavantage-wrapper#readme).

Todo:
  Import doesn't work (furthermore it shouldn't even be a button, the portfolio should import itself automatically)
  Error handling & corner cases  
  Fix variable/function naming convention  
  Fix " and ' in strings  
  Replace tabs w/ spaces
